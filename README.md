Order summary challenge from Front-End Mentor

Hi everyone. It's almost one year since i was graduated and 2021 almost over and im still unemployment lol :sad:. Anyway im developing again my front-end skill. It takes a time but im not sure if it's success. Long story short it's just a static page made by HTML and CSS more flex and rem. Owh, thank you for my stackoverflow buddies which help me reminding again about media query, and hover in a tag.

Thank you
